# M4-Lab3-Calculator
Basic calculator (no eval function)
This a simple web based calculator.
Technology:
1. HTML
2. CSS responsive
3. JS
I do not use eval function as it poses a severe security threat. 
The Math functions are presented in toggle mode under switch operator in JS.
I have done this kind of switch operator for my Module 1.
